Directed Independent Study through the UNCW Computer Science Department. Seperate from the Virtual Access to Stem Careers (VASC) sea turtle project.

The game is meant to be a learning device for elementary schoolers on protecting the oceans and the effects that plastic pollution can have on aquatic life, especially sea turtles. Grocery bags and jellyfish float down towards the sea turtle and the player has to grab the bags and throw them into the recycling bins before they reach the turtle.
